# Challenge Week 26
Use Case:  in order to audit their employee expense reports, a service company would like to calculate how far (in miles) their technician is traveling from their hotels, to the worksite, then to their destination hotel on a daily basis.

The Data:  The source is collected in a way that record 1 contains the spatial object for the beginning hotel for day 1, record 2 is the spatial object for the worksite for day 1, and record 3 is the spatial object for the ending hotel for day 1.  This pattern repeats for three successive days.

Find the distance on a daily basis the technician is either driving or straight line distance if you donâ€™t have the spatial data available.
